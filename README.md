8. There should be messages logged in your database at this point, if there aren't please verify your Mysql instance is running, and verify the database information is correct in the file "yourHomeDirectory/EclipseEventLoggerConfig/config.txt" your home directory is your user directory on windows.


# Description
Logs events triggered in Eclipse that relate to syntax and runtime
errors. The event's information is stored in a Mysql database
specified by the user in a config file located in the directory
"yourHomeDirectory/EclipseEventLoggerConfig/config.txt" if you're
on a windows computer your home directory will be your windows
account name's directory. The File will be generated by the plugin
with defaulted credentials to connect to the database, you
have the option to create the file on his own. The file is required
to be in the following format:

Server=YourDbServerLocation
Database=DesiredDatabaseName
Username=MysqlUsername
Password=MysqlPassword

The ordering of the each piece of information is not important; however, each
piece must be separated by a new line. The Mysql user will need permission to create tables.
Assuming the given account has the permission the database will
be created if it has not already been. From here all runtime
and syntax events will be logged in the database.
