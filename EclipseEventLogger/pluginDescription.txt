Logs events triggered in Eclipse that relate to syntax and runtime
errors. The event's information is stored in a Mysql database
specified by the user in a config file located in the directory
"yourHomeDirectory/EclipseEventLoggerConfig/config.txt" if you're
on a windows computer your home directory will be your windows
account name's directory. The File will be generated by the plugin
with defaulted credentials to connect to the database, the user
has the option to create the file on his own. The file is required
to be in the following format:

Server=YourDbServerLocation
Database=DesiredDatabaseName
Username=MysqlUsername
Password=MysqlPassword

The ordering of the each piece of information is not important; however, each
piece must be separated by a new line.
Assuming the given account has the permission the database will
be created if it has not already been. From here all runtime
and syntax events will be logged in the database.
